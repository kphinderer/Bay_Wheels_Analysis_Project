# Bay_Wheels_Analysis_Project
The final project in the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree involving the full analysis process.

I did my report on Bay Wheel’s data (formerly Ford GoBike). I looked at the data from 2/19/2019 (start of a new BART schedule) to 3/15/2020 (the day before the bay area’s stay at home order). The choice was made because the memory on my computer couldn’t handle any more data, I wanted to include BART data in my report, and the pandemic would have skewed the data. I did move to Kaggle Kernels to get more RAM for the analysis, but I had already started with this data.

 As stated above, I used Kaggle Kernels for this data set. I am including all related files in the appropriate places so that the Jupyter notebooks can be run outside of Kernels, but here’s a link to the data set which include the notebooks in the notebook tab:

The report was done in Google Slides. I have printed it to PDF, but you can also access it here:

The bike data is too large to submit. If you want to run the bike data cleaning, please download the data for 2/2019 to 3/2020 (or go to the Kaggle dataset).

The csv I made after cleaning the bike data is too big to submit as a file. You can either run the bike data cleaning to generate the csv or go to the Kaggle dataset.
